				I spent the summer of 2017 as an Intern at CodeChef. 
				<br/>
				My internship at CodeChef required me to teach computer programming to young kids of class 8 and 9. The aim was to inspire these students at an early age and help them prepare for the International Olympiad in Informatics(IOI). In India, students have very less exposure to programming at school level which prevents them from performing well at
				IOI. CodeChef aims to do away with this. I also had to design curriculum and resources(according to the IOI syllabus) which the students can use for preparation.

				Published a paper entitled <a href="https://www.ijser.org/onlineResearchPaperViewer.aspx?HOME-AUTOMATION.pdf" target="_blank">Home Automation</a> in the International Journal of Scientific Engineering and Research(IJSER).
				<br/>
				The main objective/aim of this IOT(Internet of Things) prototype is to save electricity by controlling electrical appliances using cell phone from any part of the world. Also the status of the electrical appliances can be received in the cell phone itself. This data can be used in many ways to save electricity.

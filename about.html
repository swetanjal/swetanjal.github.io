			Hello Everyone. I am Swetanjal Dutta...
			<br/>
			<br/>
			I am a first year undergraduate studying Computer Science at International Institute of 
			Information Technology, Hyderabad.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			I was brought up in Calcutta and did my High Schooling at La Martiniere for Boys, Kolkata.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			I love to code and build stuff using technology. I am fascinated by the way computers are 
			taught to learn to mimic things just like humans. I wish to pursue research in this field 
			of Deep Learning in future. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			My passion drives me to solving algorithmic puzzles and addictively enjoy taking part in 
			different programming competitions.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			I believe that everyone should learn to code because it gives you the power to think.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Right now, I am trying to understand various problems in the society and with my dedicated 
			pursuance and professional enthusiasm, wish to solve them with the help of technology to 
			make a safer and a better world.
			<br/>
